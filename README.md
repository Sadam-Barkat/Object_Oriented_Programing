# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

This repository provides an introduction to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++ with practical examples. It covers key OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Overview

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or **objects**, rather than functions and logic. C++ is a widely-used language for OOP, enabling modular, reusable, and organized code.

## Topics Covered

1. **Classes and Objects**: Basic building blocks of OOP, defining data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
2. **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal data using access specifiers and providing controlled access through public methods.
3. **Inheritance**: Reusing code by creating derived classes that inherit properties and behaviors from base classes.
4. **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling dynamic method overriding.
5. **Abstraction**: Focusing on essential features by hiding implementation details and providing a clear interface.

## Project Structure

Each topic is covered with dedicated examples and code files to demonstrate the concepts clearly.


## Getting Started

To explore each concept, navigate to the relevant `.cpp` files, compile, and run them in your C++ environment.

### Example Compilation

To compile and run `classes_and_objects.cpp`:
```bash
g++ basics/classes_and_objects.cpp -o classes_and_objects
./classes_and_objects

This `README.md` should provide a clear, organized overview of the topics in your Object-Oriented Programming repository. Let me know if you need any additional details or adjustments!
