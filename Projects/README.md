# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Projects

This repository contains the final projects completed at the end of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course. The projects demonstrate practical implementations of OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and more.

## Projects Overview

### 1. ATM System
An ATM simulation project that allows users to perform various banking operations like checking balances, withdrawing money, and transferring funds. It utilizes concepts like classes, functions, and user input handling.

### 2. Bank Management System
A project that simulates a simple banking system. Users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and view transaction history. The system uses inheritance and encapsulation to manage accounts and transactions.

### 3. Restaurant Menu
A project simulating a restaurant menu where users can view available dishes, place orders, and calculate the total bill. It implements inheritance for different types of dishes and polymorphism for handling orders and menu items.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Classes and Objects**: Used to define different entities like Bank Account, ATM, Menu Items.
- **Encapsulation**: Used to hide the internal data and expose necessary operations to interact with the user.
- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is applied to different types of accounts, menu items, etc., making the code more modular and reusable.
- **Polymorphism**: Function overloading and overriding were used to handle different operations based on input.
- **File Handling**: (If applicable) Used for saving transaction details or user data in files.
