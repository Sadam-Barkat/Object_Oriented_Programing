# Operator Overloading in C++ (OOP)

This repository contains the solution to the **Operator Overloading** assignment, demonstrating how to overload operators in C++ to allow custom behavior for operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc., on user-defined types.

## Overview

Operator overloading allows C++ operators to be redefined for user-defined classes, enabling them to perform operations like adding or subtracting objects of that class. This assignment focuses on overloading common operators for better readability and easier manipulation of objects.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Operator Overloading**: Redefining the meaning of operators (such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.) for user-defined types.
- **Member Functions**: Overloading operators as member functions of the class.
- **Friend Functions**: Using friend functions to overload operators that require access to private or protected data members.
- **Binary and Unary Operators**: Overloading both binary (e.g., `+`, `-`) and unary (e.g., `++`, `--`) operators.

### Example Usage

1. **Compile and Run**:
   To compile and run the `operator_overloading.cpp` file, use the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   g++ operator_overloading.cpp -o operator_overloading
   ./operator_overloading

### Explanation:
