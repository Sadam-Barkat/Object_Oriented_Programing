# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Lab Work

This repository contains lab exercises related to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++. The exercises focus on applying OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction in practical examples.

## Overview

The lab work is designed to reinforce OOP concepts through hands-on coding examples. Each lab task highlights a key OOP principle and provides an opportunity to practice and solidify understanding.

## Key Concepts Covered

1. **Classes and Objects**: Understanding how to define and work with classes and objects.
2. **Encapsulation**: Hiding data and exposing only necessary methods to interact with it.
3. **Inheritance**: Reusing code through base and derived classes.
4. **Polymorphism**: Using function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions to achieve dynamic behavior.
5. **Abstraction**: Hiding implementation details and focusing on functionality through abstract classes and interfaces.

## Lab Structure

Each lab exercise is organized into separate `.cpp` files. These files demonstrate specific OOP concepts and provide examples for practical learning.
