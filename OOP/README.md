# Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP) in C++

This repository provides an introduction to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++ with practical examples. It covers key OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

## Overview

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or **objects**, rather than functions and logic. C++ is a widely-used language for OOP, enabling modular, reusable, and organized code.

## Topics Covered

1. **Classes and Objects**: Basic building blocks of OOP, defining data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
2. **Encapsulation**: Hiding internal data using access specifiers and providing controlled access through public methods.
3. **Inheritance**: Reusing code by creating derived classes that inherit properties and behaviors from base classes.
4. **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling dynamic method overriding.
5. **Abstraction**: Focusing on essential features by hiding implementation details and providing a clear interface.

## Project Structure

Each topic is covered with dedicated examples and code files to demonstrate the concepts clearly.
